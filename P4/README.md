heuristic ideas:
- Depth Check: Not sure if this helps
- Limit Materials: Not sure if this helps
- Don't try to make a tool if you are already planning to make the same one in the future
- Don't try to make iron tools if you don't have a stone pickaxe (DOESN'T WORK: Won't try to make iron tools at all)
- Don't use worse tools if you have better ones
- Don't try to make a tool if you are planning to make a worse version of the same tool later
