# ENCODING 1
- Implement generate_successors using at least two selection strategies to build up the next population

    - We used elitist selection and roulette wheel selection.

- Implement crossover in generate_children for the Grid encoding

    - We used uniform crossover.

- Implement mutation in mutate for the Grid encoding

    - (DELETE THIS: explain your mutation rate and operator in your writeup)

# ENCODING 2

- Switch the encoding to Individual_DE and explore its outputs

    - (DELETE THIS: write down an explanation of its crossover and mutation functions)

- Improve the fitness function and mutation operator (and potentially crossover) in Individual_DE

# SUMMARY

- Pick 1 favorite level from either encoding

    - Our favorite level was...

- Play that level in the Unity player and make sure you can beat it

    - Yes, the level is beatable.
