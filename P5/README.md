# ENCODING 1
- Implement generate_successors using at least two selection strategies to build up the next population

- Implement crossover in generate_children for the Grid encoding

 - We used uniform crossover.

- Implement mutation in mutate for the Grid encoding

# ENCODING 2

- Switch the encoding to Individual_DE and explore its outputs; write down an explanation of its crossover and mutation functions, with a diagram if possible.

- Improve the fitness function and mutation operator (and potentially crossover) in Individual_DE
